  "body": "# P2P Chat App\r\n#### A simple to use chat program that uses sockets and multi-threading\r\n\r\nThis is a p2p chat program written in python. The traditional client server based chat is also supported\r\n## 1. Getting started\r\nStart the server using \r\n```sh\r\n$ python Server.py\r\n````\r\nThe clients can connect to the server through client.py\r\n```sh\r\n$ python Client.py\r\n````\r\n---\r\nThe p2p version can be started using the command\r\n```sh\r\n$ python p2p.py\r\n````\r\n----\r\nAlternatively, it can be run from the terminal itself. \r\n####1. Make the files executable\r\n```sh\r\n$chmod u+x Server.py Client.py p2p.py\r\n````\r\n####2. Run the program\r\n````sh\r\n$ ./Server.py\r\n````\r\n````sh\r\n$ ./Client.py\r\n````\r\n````sh\r\n$ ./p2p.py\r\n````\r\n----\r\nThe client asks for the hostname and the port on which the server is listening. Then an attempt is made to connect to the server. If everything is all right, the client should prompt you to start typing your messages. Else an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n##2. Things to be implemented yet\r\n- General exception handling\r\n- Some more polishing\r\n- Build a gui ;)\r\n\r\n##3. General\r\nFeel free to report bugs.
